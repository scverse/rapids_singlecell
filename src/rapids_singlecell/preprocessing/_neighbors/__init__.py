    Compute a neighborhood graph of observations with cuml.

    The neighbor search efficiency of this heavily relies on cuml,
    which also provides a method for estimating connectivities of data points -
    the connectivity of the manifold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    n_neighbors
        The size of local neighborhood (in terms of number of neighboring data
        points) used for manifold approximation. Larger values result in more
        global views of the manifold, while smaller values result in more local
        data being preserved. In general values should be in the range 2 to 100.
    n_pcs
        Use this many PCs. If `n_pcs==0` use `.X` if `use_rep is None`.
    use_rep
        Use the indicated representation. `'X'` or any key for `.obsm` is valid.
        If None, the representation is chosen automatically: For .n_vars < 50, .X
        is used, otherwise `'X_pca'` is used. If `'X_pca'` is not present, it's
        computed with default parameters or `n_pcs` if present.
    random_state
        A numpy random seed.
    algorithm
        The query algorithm to use. Valid options are:
            `'brute'`
                Brute-force search that computes distances to all data points, guaranteeing exact results.

            `'ivfflat'`
                Uses inverted file indexing to partition the dataset into coarse quantizer cells and performs the search within the relevant cells.

            `'ivfpq'`
                Combines inverted file indexing with product quantization to encode sub-vectors of the dataset, facilitating faster distance computation.

            `'cagra'`
                Employs the Compressed, Accurate Graph-based search to quickly find nearest neighbors by traversing a graph structure.

            `'nn_descent'`
                Uses the NN-descent algorithm to approximate the k-nearest neighbors.
                Note: Performance may be degraded when Dask is active.

            `'all_neighbors'`
                Uses the all-neighbors algorithm to approximate the k-nearest neighbors.
                Note: Performance may be degraded when Dask is active and algorithm is `nn_descent`.

            `'mg_ivfflat'`
                Uses the Multi-GPU inverted file indexing to partition the dataset into coarse quantizer cells and performs the search within the relevant cells.

            `'mg_ivfpq'`
                Combines Multi-GPU inverted file indexing with product quantization to encode sub-vectors of the dataset, facilitating faster distance computation.

          increase accuracy but reduce speed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    neighbors_within_batch
        How many top neighbours to report for each batch; total number of neighbours
        in the initial k-nearest-neighbours computation will be this number times
        the number of batches. This then serves as the basis for the construction
        of a symmetrical matrix of connectivities.
    n_pcs
        Use this many PCs. If `n_pcs==0` and `use_rep is None`, use `.X`.
    use_rep
        Use the indicated representation. `'X'` or any key for `.obsm` is valid.
        If `None`, the representation is chosen automatically: For `.n_vars < 50`, `.X`
        is used, otherwise `'X_pca'` is used. If `'X_pca'` is not present, it's
        computed with default parameters or `n_pcs` if present.
    random_state
        A numpy random seed.
    algorithm
        The query algorithm to use. Valid options are:

        `'brute'`
            Brute-force search that computes distances to all data points, guaranteeing exact results.
        `'ivfflat'`
            Uses inverted file indexing to partition the dataset into coarse quantizer cells and performs the search within the relevant cells.
        `'ivfpq'`
            Combines inverted file indexing with product quantization to encode sub-vectors of the dataset, facilitating faster distance computation.
        `'cagra'`
            Employs the Compressed, Accurate Graph-based search to quickly find nearest neighbors by traversing a graph structure.

        `'mg_ivfflat'`
            Uses the Multi-GPU inverted file indexing to partition the dataset into coarse quantizer cells and performs the search within the relevant cells.

        `'mg_ivfpq'`
            Combines Multi-GPU inverted file indexing with product quantization to encode sub-vectors of the dataset, facilitating faster distance computation.

        Please ensure that the chosen algorithm is compatible with your dataset and the specific requirements of your search problem.
    metric

    metric_kwds
        Options for the metric.
    algorithm_kwds
        Options for the algorithm. For `ivfflat` and `ivfpq` algorithms, the following
        parameters can be specified:

        * 'n_lists': Number of inverted lists for IVF indexing. Default is 2 * next_power_of_2(sqrt(n_samples)).

        For `mg_ivfflat` and `mg_ivfpq` algorithms, the following parameters can be specified:

        * 'distribution_mode': The distribution mode to use. Valid options are: 'replicated' and 'shared'. Default is 'replicated'.

        * 'n_probes': Number of lists to probe during search. Default is 20. Higher values
          increase accuracy but reduce speed.

    trim
        Trim the neighbours of each cell to these many top connectivities.
        May help with population independence and improve the tidiness of clustering.
        The lower the value the more independent the individual populations,
        at the cost of more conserved batch effect.
        If `None`, sets the parameter value automatically to
        10 times `neighbors_within_batch` times the number of batches.
        Set to 0 to skip.
    key_added
        If not specified, the neighbors data is stored in `.uns['neighbors']`,
        distances and connectivities are stored in `.obsp['distances']` and
        `.obsp['connectivities']` respectively.
