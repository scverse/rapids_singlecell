    """
    Diffusion maps has been proposed for visualizing single-cell data.

    This is a reimplementation of scanpys function.

    The width ("sigma") of the connectivity kernel is implicitly determined by
    the number of neighbors used to compute the single-cell graph in
    :func:`~scanpy.pp.neighbors`.

    Parameters
    ----------
        adata
            Annotated data matrix.
        n_comps
            The number of dimensions of the representation.
        neighbors_key
            If not specified, diffmap looks at `.obsp['connectivities']` for neighbors connectivities
            If specified, diffmap looks at `.obsp['neighbors_key_ connectivities']` for neighbors connectivities
        sort
            Leave as is for the same behavior as sc.tl.diffmap
        density_normalize
            Leave as is for the same behavior as sc.tl.diffmap

    Returns
    -------
        updates `adata` with the following fields.

            `X_diffmap` : :class:`numpy.ndarray` (`adata.obsm`)
                Diffusion map representation of data, which is the right eigen basis of
                the transition matrix with eigenvectors as columns.
            `diffmap_evals` : :class:`numpy.ndarray` (`adata.uns`)
                Array of size (number of eigen vectors).
                Eigenvalues of transition matrix.
