    """\
    Embed the neighborhood graph using UMAP's cuml implementation.

    UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a manifold learning
    technique suitable for visualizing high-dimensional data. Besides tending to
    be faster than tSNE, it optimizes the embedding such that it best reflects
    the topology of the data, which we represent throughout rapids-singlecell using a
    neighborhood graph. tSNE, by contrast, optimizes the distribution of
    nearest-neighbor distances in the embedding such that these best match the
    distribution of distances in the high-dimensional space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    min_dist
        The effective minimum distance between embedded points. Smaller values
        will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby points on
        the manifold are drawn closer together, while larger values will result
        on a more even dispersal of points. The value should be set relative to
        the ``spread`` value, which determines the scale at which embedded
        points will be spread out.
    spread
        The effective scale of embedded points. In combination with `min_dist`
        this determines how clustered/clumped the embedded points are.
    n_components
        The number of dimensions of the embedding.
    maxiter
        The number of iterations (epochs) of the optimization. Called `n_epochs`
        in the original UMAP.
    alpha
        The initial learning rate for the embedding optimization.
    negative_sample_rate
        The number of negative edge/1-simplex samples to use per positive
        edge/1-simplex sample in optimizing the low dimensional embedding.
    init_pos
        How to initialize the low dimensional embedding. Called `init` in the
        original UMAP. Options are:
        * 'spectral': use a spectral embedding of the graph.
        * 'random': assign initial embedding positions at random.
    random_state
        `int`, `random_state` is the seed used by the random number generator
    a
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If `None` these
        values are set automatically as determined by `min_dist` and
        `spread`.
    b
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If `None` these
        values are set automatically as determined by `min_dist` and
        `spread`.
    copy
        Return a copy instead of writing to adata.
    neighbors_key
        If not specified, umap looks .uns['neighbors'] for neighbors settings
        and .obsp['connectivities'] for connectivities
        (default storage places for pp.neighbors).
        If specified, umap looks .uns[neighbors_key] for neighbors settings and
        .obsp[.uns[neighbors_key]['connectivities_key']] for connectivities.

    Returns
    -------
    Depending on `copy`, returns or updates `adata` with the following fields.

        **X_umap** : `adata.obsm` field
            UMAP coordinates of data.
