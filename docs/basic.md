# Welcome to the rapids-singlecell documentation

Rapids-singlecell offers enhanced single-cell data analysis as a near drop-in replacement predominantly for scanpy, while also incorporating select functionalities from squidpy and decoupler. Utilizing GPU computing with cupy and Nvidiaâ€™s RAPIDS, it emphasizes high computational efficiency. As part of the scverse ecosystem, rapids-singlecell continuously aims to maintain compatibility, adapting and growing through community collaboration.

* **Broad GPU Optimization:** Facilitates accelerated processing of large datasets, particularly with GPU-enabled AnnData objects.
* **Selective scverse Library Integration:** Incorporates key functionalities from scanpy, with additional features from squidpy and decoupler.
* **Easy Installation Process:** Available via Conda and PyPI, with detailed setup guidelines.
* **Accessible Documentation:** Provides comprehensive guides and examples tailored for efficient application.

Our commitment with rapids-singlecell is to deliver a powerful, user-centric tool that significantly enhances single-cell data analysis capabilities in bioinformatics.
