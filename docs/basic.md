# Welcome to the rapids-singlecell documentation

This library is designed to accelerate single cell data analysis by utilizing the capabilities of GPU computing. Drawing inspiration from both the [scanpy](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy) library by Theis lab and the [rapids-single-cell-examples](https://github.com/clara-parabricks/rapids-single-cell-examples) library from Nvidia's RAPIDS team, it introduces GPU-optimized versions of their functions. While aiming to remain compatible with the original codes, the library's primary objective is to blend the computational strength of GPUs with the user-friendly nature of the scverse ecosystem.
