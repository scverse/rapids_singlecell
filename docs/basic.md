# Welcome to the rapids-singlecell documentation

rapids-singlecell provides GPU-accelerated single-cell analysis with an AnnData-first API. It is largely compatible with Scanpy and includes selected functionality from Squidpy and decoupler. Computations use CuPy and NVIDIA RAPIDS for performance on large datasets.

- **GPU acceleration**: Common single-cell workflows on `AnnData` run on the GPU.
- **Ecosystem compatibility**: Works with Scanpy APIs; includes pieces from Squidpy and decoupler.
- **Simple installation**: Available via Conda and PyPI.
