* Replaces CuPy RawKernel infrastructure with precompiled **nanobind/CUDA C++** extensions {pr}`455` {smaller}`S Dicks`

  All GPU kernels are now compiled at build time via scikit-build-core instead of JIT-compiled on first call, eliminating startup latency and CuPy kernel cache issues across CUDA/driver upgrades.
  Prebuilt wheels are available on PyPI as `rapids-singlecell-cu12` (CUDA 12) and `rapids-singlecell-cu13` (CUDA 13) for both x86_64 and aarch64 — no CUDA toolkit or nvcc required for installation.

  nanobind's typed array bindings enforce dtype (e.g., float32 vs float64) and memory layout (C-contiguous vs F-contiguous) at the Python/C++ boundary, catching mismatches with clear `TypeError` messages before they reach the GPU instead of producing silent corruption or cryptic CUDA errors.

  Kernels are now proper C++ with headers, templates, and multi-file organization, which will enable more optimized and composable functions that are entirely C++ in future releases.

* Rewrite Harmony correction step in C++ and remove ``use_gemm`` parameter {pr}`578` {smaller}`S Dicks`

  The ``correction_fast`` path is now a single C++ function that fuses all per-cluster operations (inverse matrix computation, scatter-add, cuBLAS GEMM/GEMV, and correction) into one kernel launch sequence with no round-trips to Python. The ``use_gemm`` parameter has been removed because the one-hot matrix ``Phi`` it controlled is no longer needed — batch membership is now handled directly via categorical indices, making the GEMM-based path obsolete.
