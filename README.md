# rapids-singlecell: GPU-Accelerated Single-Cell Analysis within scverse

Rapids-singlecell offers enhanced single-cell data analysis as a near drop-in replacement predominantly for scanpy, while also incorporating select functionalities from squidpy and decoupler. Utilizing GPU computing with cupy and Nvidiaâ€™s RAPIDS, it emphasizes high computational efficiency. As part of the scverse ecosystem, rapids-singlecell continuously aims to maintain compatibility, adapting and growing through community collaboration.

* **Broad GPU Optimization:** Facilitates accelerated processing of large datasets, with GPU-enabled AnnData objects.
* **Selective scverse Library Integration:** Incorporates key functionalities from scanpy, with additional features from squidpy and decoupler.
* **Easy Installation Process:** Available via Conda and PyPI, with detailed setup guidelines.
* **Accessible Documentation:** Provides comprehensive guides and examples tailored for efficient application.

Our commitment with rapids-singlecell is to deliver a powerful, user-centric tool that significantly enhances single-cell data analysis capabilities in bioinformatics.

## Installation
### Conda
The easiest way to install *rapids-singlecell* is to use one of the *yaml* file provided in the [conda](https://github.com/scverse/rapids_singlecell/tree/main/conda) folder. These *yaml* files install everything needed to run the example notbooks and get you started.
```
conda env create -f conda/rsc_rapids_23.04.yml
# or
mamba env create -f conda/rsc_rapids_23.10.yml
```
### PyPI
```
pip install rapids-singlecell
```
The default installer doesn't cover RAPIDS nor cupy. Information on how to install RAPIDS & cupy can be found [here](https://rapids.ai/start.html).

If you want to use RAPIDS PyPI packages, the whole library with all dependencies can be install with:
````
pip install 'rapids-singlecell[rapids11]' --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com #CUDA11.X
pip install 'rapids-singlecell[rapids12]' --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com #CUDA12
````
It is important to ensure that the CUDA environment is set up correctly so that RAPIDS and Cupy can locate the necessary libraries.
